/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Only the authenticated user can read or write their own profile data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly disallowed.
 * - No admin roles or shared access patterns are used in this prototype.
 * - Anonymous authentication is being used, which means `request.auth` will be null. This is acceptable ONLY for prototyping. In a real application, you MUST switch to a real auth provider (e.g., email/password, Google Sign-In) before launch.

     * @allow (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user with matching UID accesses their profile.
     * @deny  (get, update, delete) - Authenticated user tries to access another user's profile.
     * @deny  (list) - Listing users is not permitted.
     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.
