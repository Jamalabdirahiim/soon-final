/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles. Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * User profiles are stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Listing all users is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Data validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping, focusing on authorization.
 * - Anonymous authentication is allowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  The rules rely on the Firebase Authentication UID to match the `userId` in the document path. This avoids needing to store redundant user IDs within the document itself.

     * @deny (get, update, delete) - A user cannot read, update, or delete another user's profile.
