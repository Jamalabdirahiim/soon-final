/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles.
 * All data under `/users/{userId}` is only accessible and modifiable by the authenticated user.
 *
 * Data Structure: User profiles are stored in `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own profile data.
 * - Listing users is disallowed.
 * - Anonymous authentication is used, so `request.auth` will be non-null for all authenticated requests.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `userId` is already present in the path, making `isOwner()` checks efficient.
