/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset prioritizes developer velocity by focusing on
 * strict authentication and authorization while relaxing data validation. This
 * allows for rapid iteration on the data model without being blocked by schema
 * enforcement.
 *
 * Data Structure: The primary data structure revolves around users. Each user
 * has a profile stored under `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is explicitly denied to protect user privacy.
 * - Only authenticated users can access data.
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - No data validation is performed beyond ownership checks.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:  The user's `uid` is used as the document ID
 * in the `/users/{userId}` collection. This denormalization simplifies ownership
 * checks and avoids the need for additional reads.
