/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can create, read, update, and delete their own profile data.
 * Anonymous authentication is enabled.
 *
 * Data Structure: User profiles are stored under the `/users/{userId}` path,
 * where `{userId}` corresponds to the Firebase Authentication UID of the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Strict ownership is enforced on all write operations to prevent unauthorized data modification.
 * - No data validation is performed in this version to accelerate prototyping.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The `userId` is used as the document ID under the `/users` collection,
 * which simplifies ownership checks.

     * @deny (update, delete) - Unauthenticated user cannot modify profiles.

     * @principle Enforces document ownership for all operations.
